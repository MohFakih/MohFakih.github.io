Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm a passionate enthusiast in the field of Cyber-Physical Systems, particularly those that incorporate Machine Learning. My fascination lies heavily in the cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques, especially Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transformer-based perception models. I'm always keen on exploring and advancing the latest in these areas, focusing on optimizations and application-specific adaptations of these models.

My background in sensor and physical signal processing integrates well with my interest in novel ML models. This unique blend fuels my work in enhancing the robustness of Cyber Physical Systems that rely on sensors and actuators, especially when these systems are powered by ML.

I'm also deeply captivated by Generative Models. Their ability to mimic real-world scenarios is not just fascinating but also a fantastic resource for amateur artists like myself. They open up a world of creativity and exploration, and I love delving into this potential!

Academics
